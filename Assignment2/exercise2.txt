Exercise 2:
	- int, being a primitive data type has less flexibility. We can only store the binary value of an integer in it.
	- Since Integer is a wrapper class for int data type, it gives us more flexibility in storing, converting and manipulating an int data type
	- Integer is a class and thus it can call various in-built methods defined in the class. Variables of type Integer store references to Integer objects, just as with any other reference object type.
	- Integer class is used where we need to treat an int variable like an object. Since Wrapper classes inherit Object class. Hence, we can perform any arithmetic or logical operation between any primitive data type and any Wrapper class. We can perform a Double + Integer or double + Integer arithmetic and it will output correctly.
	- With Integer we can perform operations to manipulate the order or format of the given value, like reverse() which reverses the order of the number, rotateLeft() and rotateRight() rotates the units of the value. 
	- We can convert an integer value stored in a Integer class to Binary, Octal, Hex format by using methods within the Integer class.
	- We can't assign a String value to an int variable directly. However we can assign a String to an object of Integer type. We can even use parseInt(String) to convert a String literal to an int value.
